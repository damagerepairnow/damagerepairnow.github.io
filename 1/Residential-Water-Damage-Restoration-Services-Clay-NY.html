<p>Flooding of a personal sewer system can be a dangerous situation for homeowners, according to Plumbing 2.0's veteran plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It might result in a back-up of sewage in the home, polluted drinking water and lack of sanitation until the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions persist, a personal sewer system can not operate correctly (common pipes issues in old homes ).
