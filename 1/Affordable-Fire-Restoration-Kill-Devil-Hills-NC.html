<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

We have both a license and substantial training in completing these jobs and constantly work towards a restore over change approach. Our access to nationwide resources allows us to purchase the most recent equipment including inject dry systems and the commercial quality cleaning processes for sturdy cleaning and hand cleaning for fine information.</p>
<h3>Water Damage Mold Removal in Kill Devil Hills North Carolina</h2>
<p>Sadly, however, utilizing bleach is only efficient if the mold is growing on non-porous products such as tiles, bathtubs, glass and counter tops. Bleach can not penetrate into permeable materials therefore it does not enter contact with mold growing underneath the surface of products such as wood and drywall. Using bleach on these materials will eliminate the mold above the surface but the roots within the material will remain and the mold will quickly return.</p>

<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Kill Devil Hills</h3>
<p>Remove paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a long-term health danger and need to be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
