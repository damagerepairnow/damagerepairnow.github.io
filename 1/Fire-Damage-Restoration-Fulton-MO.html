Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, but when he found out how much water costs I was paying since the leak started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the place of the leak for me and after that even assisted me closed down my main water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going person.</p>
