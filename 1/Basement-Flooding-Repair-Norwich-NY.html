There are over 100,000 types of types of mold, but the most typical types of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore arrive on a food source that is damp and warm, it starts to sprout and colonize within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots begin to become the food source and mycotoxins or dangerous gasses are released as the fungi spreads. Mold in your home can be incredibly dangerous and result in a variety of health problems. Making reliable mold remediation more expensive and challenging if the mold in your home is not eliminated appropriately it can continue to grow.<p>
