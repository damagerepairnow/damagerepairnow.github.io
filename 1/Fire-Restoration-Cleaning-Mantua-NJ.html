<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally destructive. Jake and his men were amazing in assisting us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying out our drenched crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (typically twice a day) to keep track of and change the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the method and also were extremely valuable in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd advise them without doubt.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was easy: It was an ideal storm"-- a mix that attorneys now declare came from pressure to construct much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure materials, and little government and builder oversight.
