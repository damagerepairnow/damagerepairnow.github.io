<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Because mold spores are tiny, merely cleaning the areas that you can see is typically insufficient to deal with the problem.

Do It Yourself approaches may clean the noticeable mold, however may miss out on resolving underlying concerns, such as leakages, and may fail to contain the mold spores effectively, leading 2 to future nests in new areas of the home.</p>
