Part of our monitoring procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any modifications.</p>
