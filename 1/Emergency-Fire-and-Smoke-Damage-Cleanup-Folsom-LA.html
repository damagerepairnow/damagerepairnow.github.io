<p>Deterioration is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and progressive deterioration of materials (typically metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion happens when you integrate electrical power, water, oxygen and metal, creating iron oxide (or what is more typically referred to as rust). There is no trusted schedule for this procedure to occur; a MacBook's internal components typically start rusting right away after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can operate normally for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of a problem. How quick the rust process takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and how long the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all up until you can attend to the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust brought on by a water spill.</p>
