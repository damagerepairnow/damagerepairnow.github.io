<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold experts generally advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the service on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush until the mold vanishes.
