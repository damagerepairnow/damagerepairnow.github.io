<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
