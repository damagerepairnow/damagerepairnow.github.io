Mold frequently looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or structure materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Search for signs of wetness or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water spots, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>It only takes a small water leak, or even excess humidity, for mold to form in your Cedar Falls home or company.
