<p>In order to protect yourself from germs in the water, mold on surface areas and the chemicals in cleaning supplies, cover your body. Use pants, long sleeves, boots, and rubber gloves.

<p>You wish to resolve restroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and develops an ideal breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 steps get you on the road to flooded bathroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to lift and unsettle the dampened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health concern. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>Frequently cleaning agents or mold cleaning products will include ammonia. In that case just follow the directions on the label and make certain never to mix it with bleach.

Even after the fire trucks leave, your property will likely experience not just fire and smoke damage, but also widespread water damage and flooding from firefighting efforts.<p>
