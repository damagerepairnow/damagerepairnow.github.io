<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Experts have actually identified Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has actually affected sprawling suburban homes, starter homes, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Characteristics built with materials aside from stucco had issues, too. Some homes with water damage were developed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by small, local companies. Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>A pipe burst in my crawlspace, causing significant water accumulation. Colby and Caleb arrived on the scene within a couple of hours and continued to drain pipes the area before any damage was done to my home. Colby returned the next day and installed new insulation in the location. They supplied outstanding, effective, and professional service as well as being friendly and enjoyable to work with. I totally advise Affordable Restoration LLC and will call them again should the requirement develop.</p>
