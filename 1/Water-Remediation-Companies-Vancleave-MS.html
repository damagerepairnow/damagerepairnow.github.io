As soon as MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other elements.

This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting.

This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with a very costly paperweight if this rust procedure is not stopped.</p>
