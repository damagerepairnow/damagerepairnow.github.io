<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does.
