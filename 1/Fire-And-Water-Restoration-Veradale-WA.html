Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be fixed rather than being totally replaced. Then the majority of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard might need repairing, if there is small damage.

The kind of wood floor covering you may have limits the type and identifies of repairs that require to happen. Strong hardwood flooring allows for a broader range of alternatives to fix the issue.
