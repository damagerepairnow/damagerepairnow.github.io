<p>Given that it's difficult to eliminate mold in your home completely, it's important to keep your air clear by frequently replacing air filters. Consider using High Performance Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, which are developed to trap 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or bigger (mold is normally 3 - 12 microns) in order to keep mold from distributing.

Discover one with an antimicrobial filter to make sure that the filter itself remains free from mold if you live in an especially damp environment.</p>

Part of our monitoring process includes examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any adjustments.</p>
