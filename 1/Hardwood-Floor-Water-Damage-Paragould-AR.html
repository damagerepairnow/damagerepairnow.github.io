<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely harmful. Jake and his guys were fantastic in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace right away. They came back every day (typically two times a day) to keep track of and change the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the method and also were extremely helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
