<h3>Water Damage In Home in Somerville New Jersey</h2>
<p>If you see mold growth on a floor, ceiling or wall, possibilities are you have a water damage issue in your home that is causing the mold. At HCI Fire and Water Restoration, we will be able to totally evaluate the situation and identify any covert leaks or sources of water intrusion. Not only will we be able to remediate the mold, but we will also be able to deal with the water source of the issue quickly and successfully.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has absorbed (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) remove the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any adjustments.</p>
<p>Class 1 - least amount of water, absorption, and evaporation load. Water invasion where wet, porous materials (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), fabrics) represent less than ~ 5% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the space; and where products referred to as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floorings, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have actually taken in very little moisture.</p>
