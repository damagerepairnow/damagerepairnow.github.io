<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. Juice three to five lemons and pour over afflicted location. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a damp towel.

Plus, we utilize water detection probes to discover hidden water damage cleanup problems that could cause mold growth, rusted pipelines or other issues. Our full variety of water damage remediation services consists of repair or replacement of structural aspects such as decayed wood or ruined drywall, and cleaning or defense of decorative products or individual contents.</p>
<p>When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. Eliminate plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health threat and need to be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, duct and wiring.</p>
