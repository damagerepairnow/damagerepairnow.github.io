<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. Juice three to five lemons and pour over afflicted location. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a damp towel.

Plus, we utilize water detection probes to discover hidden water damage cleanup problems that could cause mold growth, rusted pipelines or other issues.

<p>When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. Eliminate plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health threat and need to be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, duct and wiring.</p>
