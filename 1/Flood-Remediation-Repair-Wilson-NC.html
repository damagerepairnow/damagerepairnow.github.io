<p>First things first - prepare what you need Essentially, you need a reliable product in cleaning mold. Numerous family owners believe that bleach is an efficient mold treatment. However contrary to the popular view, it isn't. Bleach is a strong chemical which can hurt your health. Likewise, it does not get rid of the mold. It just alters its color from black to grey or white. After a few weeks of lightening, there is still a huge possibility that the mold will return.</p>

<p>The Restoration CleanUp Company is CA accredited (814028) and certified by IICRC (Institute of Evaluation Cleaning & Restoration Accreditation - Cert # 86122). For over 30 years we have remained in the cleaning and restoration industry and strictly follow up‐to‐date procedures for cleanup and disinfection.

<p>The most significant element that can be eliminated is the wetness that mold needs to cultivate. There are over 100,000 types of types of mold, but the most common types of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore lands on a food source that is moist and warm, it begins to germinate and colonize within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots start to become the food source and mycotoxins or harmful gasses are launched as the fungis spreads. Mold in your house can be extremely hazardous and result in a range of health concerns. If the mold in your home is not removed effectively it can continue to grow, making efficient mold remediation more costly and tough.<p>
