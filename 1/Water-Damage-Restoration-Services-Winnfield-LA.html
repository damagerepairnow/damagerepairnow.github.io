<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of up to 18 inches of drywall due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a serious health hazard.

If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
