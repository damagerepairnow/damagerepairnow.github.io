<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out how much water expense I was paying given that the leak started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the location of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely respectful individual.</p>
