<p>You want to address restroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and creates a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the roadway to flooded bathroom healing. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to lift and unsettle the dampened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health concern. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>Call us immediately for flood damage cleanup since the water can spread damage quickly. Current Review: The agent was timely, professional and helpful. After doing tests for water and mold, he described the problems (leak in dishwashing machine plumbing triggering considerable water damage inside the cabinet) and what remediation efforts would be required. High-Capacity Air Movers produce a vortex, similar to the motion of a tornado. This technique speeds up the drying procedure.<p>
