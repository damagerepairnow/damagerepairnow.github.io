<p>Current Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were very delighted that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job properly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Scrub mold off hard surfaces with cleaning agent and water, and dry totally. The most typical form of damage, specifically if the leaking water heater isn't fixed in a timely way, is mold and mildew. Mold can be especially hazardous to particular people and need to be treated quickly. For instance, after a fire is extinguished your concerns are still not over since ash, soot, and water remains. We want you to understand that we have your back.<p>
<p>After scrubbing the surface areas, enable the bleach option to continue to penetrate the surface areas and dry. Getting a location dry needs getting rid of the wetness not only from the afflicted materials however also from the air. Fans will blow air throughout the surface area and trigger the water to vaporize, then the dehumidifiers will draw it out of the air and drain it so that it won't settle back into the product and cause more damage to the room.<p>
