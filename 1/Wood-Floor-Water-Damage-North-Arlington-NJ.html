These conditions can help in identifying what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and sensible energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to several building materials and how they respond to each one and provide the best evaporation results.
