<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As pointed out, rapid air motion across wet surface areas of assemblies or products is an important part of efficiently and effectively drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or products. Fast air motion throughout the surface area of product becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of getting rid of surface wetness gives way to decreasing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The continuous and falling rates of drying products need various requirements for altering conditions.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water intrusion that includes a significant quantity of water absorption into low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floorings, or other complex, developed assemblies). Drying may require unique techniques, longer drying times, or substantial water vapor pressure differentials.</p>
