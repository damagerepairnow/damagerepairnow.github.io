Tri-Sodium Phosphate and 1 cup family cleaner or chlorine bleach for each gallon of warm water you will use.

These filters are checked and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This procedure goes on for days.
