<p>Because typical building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
