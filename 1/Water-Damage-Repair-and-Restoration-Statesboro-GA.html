<p>Any structure that has suffered from water damage or issues with excess wetness is at risk of mold development. Wear a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore security, and cover legs, arms and hands to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to get rid of visible mold. If the musty location is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will decrease the incidence of air-borne mold spores during cleaning. Next, utilize commercial black mold removal products, which can be found in many hardware or home repair stores, to decontaminate the musty areas, in addition to any nearby areas. If you use bleach, ensure it won't discolor the product or surface. Place all sponges, devices and other materials utilized in cleaning in a sturdy garbage bag, and if possible, eliminate the bag through a close-by exit rather than the main house, to avoid distributing mold spores.</p>
