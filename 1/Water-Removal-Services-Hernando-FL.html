Conditions conducive to drying at the surface differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Quick air movement across the surface of material becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface wetness gives way to reducing moisture material in low evaporation materials. The consistent and falling rates of drying materials need various criteria for changing conditions.</p>
