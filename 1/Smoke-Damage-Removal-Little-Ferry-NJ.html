<p>Utilizing bleach or other chemicals to kill indoor mold growth is not required in most cases. The objective must be to eliminate mold growth by cleaning or getting rid of moldy materials. Dead mold can still present health risks if you are exposed. Utilizing bleach or other disinfectants on surface areas after mold removal might be required where people are believed to be susceptible to fungal infections (such as an individual with immune system problems). Should you choose to utilize bleach or another chemical, please read and thoroughly follow the label directions and hazard declarations (care, caution, danger).

Start cleaning the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly using a clean surface area. When all sides are soiled, slice off the sides with a knife to expose fresh surfaces below. Or merely grab a new sponge. Make certain you use a wiping motion the whole time. If you scrub the spots, you may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface.</p>
