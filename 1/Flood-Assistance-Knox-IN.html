<p>Mold - the appearance, the odor, even the thought of it makes you recoil. You most likely have visions of long-forgotten takeout food stuffed in the back of your refrigerator, or an old shabby bathtub that hasn't been used in years.

After eliminating all contaminated and damp materials, contact somebody who can examine your home and start the restoration procedure.<p>
<p>While the iPhone 7 and later on are waterproof, it doesn't stop water from entering the speaker grille. The Apple Watch Series 2 and later on have a similar concern, although they come with a built-in function that can be toggled to 'eject' the water by playing a specific frequency. The worst problem with mold is that it has the possible to cause health results. Mold can trigger allergic reactions and even asthma attacks, as some people are allergic to mold. As mold requires water to grow it is important to prevent wetness and humidity problems in buildings, especially ones affected by water.<p>
