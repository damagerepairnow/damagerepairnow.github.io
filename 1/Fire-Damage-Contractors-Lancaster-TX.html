<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying equipment or methods will be the most effective. It is important to determine if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based upon the outdoors temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in identifying what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and practical energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately forecasts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to several structure materials and how they respond to each one and offer the best evaporation outcomes. The greater the number, the faster materials will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more valuable if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
