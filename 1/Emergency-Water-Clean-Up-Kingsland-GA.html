<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of home damage that a family or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a really pricey paperweight.</p>
