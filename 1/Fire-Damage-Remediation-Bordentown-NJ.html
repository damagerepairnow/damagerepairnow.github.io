<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
