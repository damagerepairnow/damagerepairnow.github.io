<p>Water Damage Restoration Seattle WA. Step the height and width of the area you're fixing so that you understand just how much brand-new wallboard you need. If you need custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, utilize your measurements to cut a spot to fit, using an utility knife or drywall saw. Align your new panel with the wall studs and then secure the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power chauffeur. Use joint tape to cover the seams where each panel satisfies. Then apply joint compound over the tape, utilizing a putty knife. Let the substance dry for the time defined by the producer and after that sand the substance with fine-grit sandpaper up until the joints are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
<p>Even when you consist of a little indoor fire, smoke damage can occur.
