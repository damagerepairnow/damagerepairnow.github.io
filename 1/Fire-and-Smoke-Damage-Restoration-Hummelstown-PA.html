NFIP is readily available through your insurer or local Federal Emergency Management (FEMA) workplace. Their web site is also an exceptional resource for extra details about water floods, including readiness, data and disaster support services.</p>

Another point is, there are different levels of contamination with water (see Categories of Water), and that will factor into the formula of what can be saved and what must be changed. We will work with you throughout the loss, reserving items that we feel can not be efficiently brought back so you can make a list to turn into your insurance adjuster. Your Adjuster will then determine a compensation for your products according to the regards to your policy.</p>
