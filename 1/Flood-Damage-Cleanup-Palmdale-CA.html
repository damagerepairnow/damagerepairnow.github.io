<p>Any building that has actually suffered from water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold development. Use a respirator or a facemask ranked for black mold spore security, and cover hands, arms and legs to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate visible mold. If the moldy area is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will minimize the incidence of airborne mold spores during cleaning. Next, use commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in most hardware or home repair stores, to disinfect the moldy locations, in addition to any surrounding areas. If you utilize bleach, make certain it won't stain the material or surface. Place all sponges, equipment and other materials used in cleaning in a heavy duty trash can, and if possible, eliminate the bag through a nearby exit instead of the primary home, to avoid dispersing mold spores.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, attempt to maintain the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter and less than 60 percent the rest of the year.
