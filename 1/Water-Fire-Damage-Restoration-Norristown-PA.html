<p>Fire Damage is the most devastating sort of home damage that a family or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with a really costly paperweight if this corrosion procedure is not stopped.</p>
