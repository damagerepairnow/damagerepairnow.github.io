<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or business is among the most destructive things that can happen to a household or an individual. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be fixed rather than being fully changed. Then the majority of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard may need fixing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is major then the entire floor might need changing and sometimes even the subfloor also. The type of wood flooring you might have limits the type and figures out of repairs that need to occur. Solid hardwood flooring allows for a larger series of alternatives to repair the issue. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface area. This kind of flooring can also have replacements for private slabs. The very best way to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the afflicted boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
