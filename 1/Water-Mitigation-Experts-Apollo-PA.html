What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
