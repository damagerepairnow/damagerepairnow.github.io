If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this deterioration procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely pricey paperweight.</p>

Drywall and other kinds of wall products usually don't dry very well, so if your walls are soaked, it's usually best to rip them out to prevent mold, especially if they aren't completely dry within two days.
