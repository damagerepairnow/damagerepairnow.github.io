What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run.

The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
