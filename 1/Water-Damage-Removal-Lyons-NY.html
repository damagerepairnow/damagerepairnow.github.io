<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Look for visible mold development (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or leathery and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Try to find signs of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>The most important aspect of remedying drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew. When moist drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew take place most regularly. No matter the area or extent of the damage, we recommend utilizing dehumidifiers, commercial fans, or similar devices that can move a big volume of air for maximum ventilation. Basic household fans are not capable of moving a sufficient amount of air needed to dry a room effectively.</p>
