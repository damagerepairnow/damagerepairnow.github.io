<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air till they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the exact same way, so if the place the spores land is excellent and moist, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
