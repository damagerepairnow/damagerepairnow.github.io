<p>The most essential aspect of fixing drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew happen most regularly when moist drywall sits with insufficient ventilation. Regardless of the location or level of the damage, we encourage using dehumidifiers, industrial fans, or similar machines that can move a large volume of air for optimum ventilation. Standard home fans are not capable of moving a sufficient amount of air required to dry a room sufficiently.</p>

<p>Sadly, however, using bleach is only reliable if the mold is growing on non-porous products such as tiles, tubs, glass and countertops. Bleach can not penetrate into porous materials therefore it does not enter into contact with mold growing below the surface area of products such as wood and drywall. Using bleach on these products will eliminate the mold above the surface but the roots within the product will stay and the mold will quickly return.</p>
