<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
