<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Black mold can be harmful to your health, primarily causing breathing problems. But in serious cases and for individuals with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can lead to pneumonia. When you think a mold invasion, you may want to invest in a mold testing set to see what type of mold spores you're dealing with, and hire a professional to assist with removal. However in the short-term, here are some natural home treatments (made with things you likely currently have on-hand) that will help eradicate mold.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, attempt to maintain the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter and less than 60 percent the rest of the year. You can buy gadgets to measure relative humidity at some home supply shops. Ventilation, air blood circulation near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to reduce the production of moisture in the home are all very crucial in controlling high humidity that regularly causes mold development in our environment.</p>
