<p>Due to the fact that typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or wetness direct exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
