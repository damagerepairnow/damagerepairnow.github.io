<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I found First Reaction online, and they were out within the hour. It was an extreme experience, but everything they did for me was fantastic. When they were providing me issues, they best thing about First Response was that they were able to handle my insurance coverage company. This probably helped me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and handled the problem for me, which was a huge relief. They were really expert, and I liked everybody I dealt with from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repair work were handled to my fulfillment. I would utilize them again.<p>
<p>Also, because bleach is mostly water, on permeable surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is quickly soaked up by the product. So, while you may have rubbed out or tarnished the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've actually offered lots of water to grow back and perhaps spread out the mold beneath the surface. If there is a lot of mold development, seek advice from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's assistance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ".  variations of these and other guidance files are readily available on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the musty product is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement might be needed.<p>
