<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Water damage can be the starting point for numerous severe problems that can impact a structure, damage personal property and present severe health threats to occupants.

Furthermore, they need to be able to communicate with the water damage victims and insurance company representatives with confidence and authority. Water damaged structures can be the best breeding place for mold, while bad indoor ventilation can cause molds to thrive. Wet structure products and humid indoor air are mold's best friends.</p>
