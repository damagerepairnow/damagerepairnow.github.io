<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Daily moisture readings ought to be included in the drying record to include equipment, air, and heating and cooling systems. Wetness content levels for wet structural products should be tape-recorded in a wetness content spreadsheet to reveal the progress of drying These recorded wetness content readings will show that the building is back to an acceptable variety of pre-loss condition. It is important to understand that air records alone will not prove that a structure is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will show if enough dehumidification is being utilized or if adjustments are needed.</p>
