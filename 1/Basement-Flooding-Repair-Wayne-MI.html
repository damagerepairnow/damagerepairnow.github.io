<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and carried away whatever else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to do the job effectively. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>

The worst problem with mold is that it has the potential to cause health impacts. Mold can activate allergies and even asthma attacks, as some people are allergic to mold. As mold requires water to grow it is essential to avoid moisture and humidity problems in buildings, specifically ones affected by water.<p>
