<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Look for visible mold development (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or leathery and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Look for signs of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, try to maintain the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the rest of the year.

Once inside the dehumidifier so more condensation can form on the internal cooling coils, lgr dehumidifiers utilize a double cooling or enhanced step to reduce the moisture-laden air temperature.</p>
