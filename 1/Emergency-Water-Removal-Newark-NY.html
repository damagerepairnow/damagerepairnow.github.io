Experts have actually labeled Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has impacted sprawling suburban houses, starter homes, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike.

<p>As moisture is launched in the air, nature constantly attempts to reach equilibrium. Calculating the humidity is necessary in drying since when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The humidity always happens at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas type. If the air were to be cooled even more, water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid form. The higher the humidity rises, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
<p>Because his house would not sell, one Bucks County man was required to stop a job he took in another state. Another man's insurance company threatened to drop protection if he didn't repair the damage, he stated.
