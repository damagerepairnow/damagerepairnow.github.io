<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and hauled away whatever else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their understanding and capabilities to get the job done appropriately. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>

Unbeknownst to the majority of us, a bulk of the furnace ventilation systems go through that area. When the monster roars to life, we frequently have no idea there is a problem until now. Check for any funny smells that could be caused by water and mold in the crawl area.<p>
<p>Do not touch or try to clean carpets, upholstered furniture, drapes or other family textile products. Those cleaning actions will only smear soot into the material, making cleaning harder. Use a dry, absorbent cloth to clean down the phone. Get all of the excess wetness off with an absorbent fabric. Make sure to get the moisture out of the charging port, the volume keys, the earphone jack and any other crevices.<p>
