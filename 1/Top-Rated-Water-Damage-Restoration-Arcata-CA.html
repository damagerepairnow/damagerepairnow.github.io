<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been shown ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
