Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he discovered just how much water costs I was paying because the leak began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the area of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and extremely courteous person.</p>
