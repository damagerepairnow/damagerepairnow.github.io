<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may show noticeable indications of wetness, dripping water, or signs of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might collapse or sag under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous plaster product. Other times, you might notice small signs like coffee-colored stains that might broaden with time.</p>
<p>When water freezes, it broadens, and that can be a problem for your home. Frozen water can cause pipes to burst, causing messy and costly repair. Luckily, there are steps you can require to prevent a water catastrophe. As the temperature level drops, keep a steady drip of water going to help prevent freezing. Pay special attention to pipes in basements, garages, the back of cabinets, and other locations that may not be getting the same amount of heat as other locations in your house. Covering them in a layer of insulation can go a long way in preventing a burst.</p>
