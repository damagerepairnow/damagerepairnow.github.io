Bleach can not penetrate into porous products therefore it does not enter contact with mold growing beneath the surface of materials such as wood and drywall. Using bleach on these materials will kill the mold above the surface but the roots within the material will stay and the mold will quickly return.</p>
<p>Finally, we wish to deal with the use of bleach on mold. Using bleach on visible mold growth is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Specialist Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can impact individuals with chemical sensitivities particularly if used in areas that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at removing mold than a damp cloth and a mild cleaning agent, so we suggest the least poisonous choice.</p>
