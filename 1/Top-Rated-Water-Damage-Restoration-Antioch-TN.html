Black mold has actually been linked with a variety of health problems, making many house owners fretted about the threats of it appearing in their home.</p>
<p>A good way to avoid mold from growing in your house is to lower humidity and condensation. After a rainy Seattle day, examine your home for leaks. If water does enter your home, mop it up quickly and dry the area. Also, try to increase your home's ventilation by opening windows (when it's not drizzling, of course) or putting fans in your room. And keep your indoor humidity listed below 60%.</p>
<h3>Fire Restoration Services in Antioch</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a long-term health hazard and need to be gotten rid of if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
