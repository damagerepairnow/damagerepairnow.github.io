<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your house or business is one of the most devastating things that can happen to an individual or a household. Emergency Restoration Services, LLC will examine the level of the damage to your property and will attempt to save as a number of your home and individual possessions such as devices, furnishings, and clothes as we can. This procedure involves looking at how far the soot, fire, and smoke have traveled, in addition to seeing how significantly the fire impacted your walls and furniture. Just by understanding the extent of the damage can we develop a strategy, an estimate for just how much the restoration need to cost, and an estimate of the length of time it will take.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The most significant step in the process is restoration. Restoration involves changing materials like drywall and insulation. In some cases this process is as easy as installing a couple of panels of drywall, while major cases might need changing entire walls. Direct exposure to harmful compounds like lead and asbestos is possible throughout restoration. Older homes are likely to contain these compounds.</p>

<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for every two to three spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it goes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which indicates that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can think of, over the course of numerous days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
