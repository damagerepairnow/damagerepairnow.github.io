<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying equipment or techniques will be the most effective. It is necessary to determine if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature level and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can help in identifying what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and reasonable energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly forecasts the energy evaluation of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure products and how they respond to each one and provide the best evaporation outcomes. The greater the number, the quicker products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
