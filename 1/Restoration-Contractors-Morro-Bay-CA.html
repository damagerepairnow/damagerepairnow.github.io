<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly harmful. Jake and his people were fantastic in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to your home and started drying our soaked crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (often twice a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.

They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd advise them without doubt.</p>
<p>Negative air devices, geared up with HEPA (high performance particle air filters") should be used to eliminate germs and other pollutants from the air during restoration work.
