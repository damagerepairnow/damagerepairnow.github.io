<h3>Water & Fire Damage Repair‎ in Bothell</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health danger and must be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
<p>To kill mold: Use white distilled vinegar and pour it into a spray bottle without watering it down. Spray the vinegar onto the moldy surface area and leave it to sit for an hour.

Whether you wish to sue might depend upon your approximated expenses, your deductible, and your specific policy. Fischer recommends that you evaluate your specific policy, and reach out to your insurance provider as early as possible while doing so so you can get the best guidance on whether or not and when to file a real claim.<p>
