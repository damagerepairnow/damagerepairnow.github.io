Mold also needs a food source, oxygen and a temperature level in between 40 degrees and 100 degrees F. Normally, a minimum of 4 air movers per space is required. to effectively dry the structure. Air motion has actually been proven to increase the drying rate. The amount of air movers used on the website will be identified by among our licensed specialists who will use the IICRC requirement.<p>
<p>After we assess the storm and examine damage, we begin immediately on water removal, as water will continue to soak into the floorings, walls, furniture, and other areas of the home with each passing minute. To manage air-borne spores, dampen musty areas with a garden sprayer while you work.
