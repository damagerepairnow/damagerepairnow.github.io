Mold also needs a food source, oxygen and a temperature level in between 40 degrees and 100 degrees F. Normally, a minimum of 4 air movers per space is required. to effectively dry the structure. Air motion has actually been proven to increase the drying rate. The amount of air movers used on the website will be identified by among our licensed specialists who will use the IICRC requirement.<p>
