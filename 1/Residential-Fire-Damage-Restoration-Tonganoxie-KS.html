<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
