<p>Deterioration is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the slow and progressive degeneration of materials (typically metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the rust occurs when you combine electrical power, oxygen, water and metal, developing iron oxide (or what is more typically referred to as rust).

How quick the corrosion process takes depends upon a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and for how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all up until you can deal with the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration triggered by a water spill.</p>
