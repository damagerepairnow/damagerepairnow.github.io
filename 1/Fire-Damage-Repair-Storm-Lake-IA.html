<p>Fire is the outcome of a chain reaction between the oxygen that exists in the environment and a source of flammable fuel.

While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can cause long lasting damage and needs to be handled by experienced specialists, heat is the most noticeable, and destructive, item of this chain reaction.
