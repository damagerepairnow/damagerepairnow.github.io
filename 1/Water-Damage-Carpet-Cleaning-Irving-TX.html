<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Irving - Restore Your Home and Your Life After Fire</h3>
<p>I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the present rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying given that the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the place of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Really respectful and easy-going person.<p>
