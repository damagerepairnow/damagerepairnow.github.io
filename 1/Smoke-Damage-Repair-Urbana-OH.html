Ceiling drywall panels might fall apart or sag under the weight of water that fills the naturally porous gypsum material. Other times, you might discover little signs like coffee-colored spots that may expand over time.</p>
<p>To eliminate mold in the basement, scrub the walls using a large brush, and bear in mind that porous surface areas such as ceiling tiles or drywall might need to be gotten rid of and replaced.
