<p>Deterioration is a process, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the slow and progressive deterioration of products (generally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion happens when you combine electricity, water, metal and oxygen, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly called rust). There is no trusted schedule for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components generally begin wearing away instantly after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can work usually for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of a problem. How quickly the corrosion procedure takes depends upon a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can attend to the damage. Below are a few examples of rust brought on by a water spill.</p>
