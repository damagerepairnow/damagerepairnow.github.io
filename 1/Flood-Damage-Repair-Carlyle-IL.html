<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
