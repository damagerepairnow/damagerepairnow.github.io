<p>Fire is the outcome of a chemical reaction in between the oxygen that exists in the atmosphere and a source of combustible fuel. Once this combustible fuel - furnishings, carpet, or drywall - has actually been heated up to its unique ignition temperature, the fuel will catch fire and volatile gases will be launched in the type of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can trigger lasting damage and must be handled by experienced experts, heat is the most noticeable, and harmful, product of this chain reaction.
