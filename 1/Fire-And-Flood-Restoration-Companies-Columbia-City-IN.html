<h3>Fire Restoration Cleaning in Columbia City</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repair work, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By decreasing the thickness here, it's much easier to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is necessary to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the job is finished.<p>
