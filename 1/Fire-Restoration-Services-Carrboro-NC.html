<p>The Epa (EPA) advises discarding materials that haven't been completely cleaned up and dried within 2 days of water damage. Fix any leakages or underlying problems right now to help prevent mold growth or its return. Mold exists naturally in the air inside and beyond your home. For that reason, it is not possible to entirely remove" all of the mold from within a structure, as microscopic spores will still exist even after the problem has been dealt with.<p>
<p>It is necessary to remember that if you have excessive amounts of wetness or humidity in your home, you may discover mold growing anywhere, including on the inside of closet doors, in carpeting, and on materials. Mold, under the ideal conditions and with a little time can grow.  What might appear like a little water leak can actually cause a more severe mold issue. Mold is naturally happening, it's natures way of turning things back into the dirt; mold is a natural recycler.
