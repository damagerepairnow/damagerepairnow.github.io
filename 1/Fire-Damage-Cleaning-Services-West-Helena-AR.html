<p>Whether it occurs in your ceiling because of a leaky roofing system, condensation from your central air, or flooding, repairing water-damaged drywall can cause you anxiety and aggravation, especially if you have actually never done it previously. Mold on the outside of your house isn't simply unattractive - it can also eventually move to the interior and trigger more damage. A common location where mold may appear on the exterior of a home consists of the decks, which can be cleaned up with detergent or other light cleaning option and a power washer. Clean vinyl or wood siding by power scrubbing or cleaning with a brush - hydrogen peroxide is a good solution option, as it will not harm your landscaping For stucco or concrete walls, use a garden hose and sprayer attachment. Rinse the siding initially, spray on non-toxic mold cleaner, permit it to sit while the mold begins to liquify, then wash it away.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is an extreme, corrosive chemical.
