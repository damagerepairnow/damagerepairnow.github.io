<h3>Fire And Water Restoration in Felton</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold specialists typically recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the solution on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush till the mold disappears. Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such products soak up water easily. This might exacerbate the problem since as you know - mold likes moist environments.<p>
