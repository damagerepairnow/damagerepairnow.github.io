<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same method, so if the place the spores land is good and damp, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>To avoid mold and practice adequate kitchen area maintenance, open windows to enhance ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning. Wipe water from tough surface areas, and repair leaky faucets as soon as possible. Always make sure your tableware and serving meals are dry before keeping them to keep mold from proliferating in cabinets. Scrub mold from surfaces as quickly as it appears, then be sure to dry the area to avoid it from spreading.</p>
