<p>You wish to address bathroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and produces a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the roadway to flooded bathroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to raise and agitate the dampened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue. After scrubbing completely with the brush, wipe the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>After scrubbing the surfaces, allow the bleach option to continue to penetrate the surface areas and dry. Getting an area dry requires getting rid of the moisture not only from the affected products but likewise from the air. Fans will blow air across the surface and trigger the water to evaporate, then the dehumidifiers will draw it out of the air and drain it so that it will not settle back into the material and trigger further damage to the room.<p>
