<p>11. Drywall and other types of wall products generally do not dry extremely well, so if your walls are soaked, it's normally best to rip them out to avoid mold, especially if they aren't absolutely dry within two days. Like bleach, ammonia will kill mold on tough non-porous surface areas such as counter tops, glass or tiles but it is ineffective at eliminating mold growing in permeable material such as wood or drywall.<p>
<p>You want to resolve bathroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and produces an ideal breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 steps get you on the roadway to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to raise and agitate the dampened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
