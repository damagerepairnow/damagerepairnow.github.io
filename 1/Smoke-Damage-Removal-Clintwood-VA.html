<p>Discover how to remove black mold safely and effectively. Getting the pieces in the aftermath of the storm can be both physically and mentally taxing. When it comes to restoration, these natural disasters leave behind billions of dollars worth of damage making it challenging to understand where to start. We have actually brought structure and contracting experience into our franchise over the past 2 and a half years to much better serve our communities after suffering a natural disaster.</p>
<p>Because common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or moisture direct exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
