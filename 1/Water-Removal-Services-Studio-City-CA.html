<p>11. Drywall and other types of wall products usually do not dry effectively, so if your walls are soaked, it's usually best to rip them out to avoid mold, specifically if they aren't absolutely dry within 48 hours. Like bleach, ammonia will eliminate mold on tough non-porous surfaces such as countertops, glass or tiles but it is ineffective at eliminating mold growing in porous material such as wood or drywall.<p>
<p>If walls have currently dried, work from the floor to the ceiling to avoid streaking. (Filthy water splashed on dry walls may be taken in and become almost difficult to eliminate.)
