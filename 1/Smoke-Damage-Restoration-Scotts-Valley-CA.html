<p>Because typical building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally related to water or wetness exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
