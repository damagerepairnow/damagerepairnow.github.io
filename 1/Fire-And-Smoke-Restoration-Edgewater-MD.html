Calculating the humidity is necessary in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point always occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature the air needs to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to accomplish an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas kind. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid kind if the air were to be cooled even more.

<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a costs for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying since the leak began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and very courteous individual.</p>
