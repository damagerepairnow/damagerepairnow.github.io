<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to get the job done effectively. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
