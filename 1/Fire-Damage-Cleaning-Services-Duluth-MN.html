Did you know that smoke is actually made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that due to the fact that smoke increases into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve browsing a large area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
