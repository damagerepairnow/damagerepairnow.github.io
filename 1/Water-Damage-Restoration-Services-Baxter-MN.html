<p>When standing water is eliminated, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature level as well, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any modifications if you have questions on this.</p>
<p>Next usage the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to clean the soot and smoke discolorations. This phase is essential, as these sponges use special chemicals to lift discolorations from walls. Never utilize soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread the soot and make it difficult to eliminate with a chemical sponge. Begin wiping the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're always using a clean surface area. When all sides are soiled, trim the sides with a knife to expose fresh surface areas beneath. Or simply get a brand-new sponge. Make sure you use a cleaning movement the whole time. You might spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface if you scrub the spots.</p>
