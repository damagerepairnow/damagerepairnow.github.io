<h3>Affordable Fire Restoration Companies in Newark</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and need to be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>A portable dehumidifier can get rid of water vapor from the air in an included location, like a bedroom or downstairs rec room.

Get the iPhone out of the water immediately, if you have not currently. And don't even think about plugging it in.<p>
