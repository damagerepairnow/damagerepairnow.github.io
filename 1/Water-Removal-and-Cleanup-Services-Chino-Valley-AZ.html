<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or business is among the most disastrous things that can happen to an individual or a household. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed instead of being completely changed. Then the bulk of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard may need fixing, if there is small damage.

<p>Since common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or moisture direct exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete).

Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
