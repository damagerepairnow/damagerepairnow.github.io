As discussed, rapid air motion throughout wet surface areas of products or assemblies is an important part of effectively and efficiently drying the surface of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or products.

The continuous and falling rates of drying products require different criteria for changing conditions.</p>
<p>The most essential aspect of treating drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew.

Standard family fans are not efficient in moving an appropriate quantity of air required to dry a room properly.</p>
