<h3>Affordable Fire Restoration Companies in Gray</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and should be gotten rid of. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>States do not bring a license requirement for water damage and restoration, however the ANSI-IICRC certification can be a requirement with claims adjusters and insurance representatives.
