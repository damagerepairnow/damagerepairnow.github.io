<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we equip the home with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for every single two to three rooms, depending on the size of the room. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it passes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and accredited to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which suggests that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This process goes on for days.
