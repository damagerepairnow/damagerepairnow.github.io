Wear long sleeves and trousers to safeguard your skin. You must also wear gloves and eye security. Since you will be releasing soot as you clean, it is necessary to lay down floor protection and remove any furniture or family items that are not damaged. If the damaged area is little, you can most likely get away with merely covering furnishings with plastic or sheets.
