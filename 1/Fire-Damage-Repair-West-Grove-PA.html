<p>If a pipe in your home has leaked for months and gone without repair work, mold can grow as an outcome, however it will not be covered by your house owners insurance.

LGR dehumidifiers use a double cooling or enhanced step to lower the moisture-laden air temperature as soon as inside the dehumidifier so more condensation can form on the internal cooling coils.</p>
