<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were really pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done properly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Mold that is growing on basement walls or other surfaces might be scrubbed with one part bleach to eight parts water. Mold is a kind of intrusive fungi that might grow on surface areas inside your home. It varies in color and type, and is typically found in locations that have actually been subjected to moisture at some point in time, such as bathrooms or in areas around dripping pipes. Prior to you start a job like this, give the water damaged area a good clean. This is the textbook initial step in any paint task, including fixing water damage on walls. We advise utilizing something like a Selleys Sugar Soap with a wet fabric and after that enabling time for the location to dry.<p>
