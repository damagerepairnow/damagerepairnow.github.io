<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
