<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have actually ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
