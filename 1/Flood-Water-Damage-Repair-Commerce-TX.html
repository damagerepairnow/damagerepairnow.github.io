<h3>Fire And Restoration in Commerce</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repairs, keep in mind that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By lowering the density here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is very important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the task is finished.<p>
