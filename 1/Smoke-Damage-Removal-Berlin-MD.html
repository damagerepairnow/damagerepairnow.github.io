<h2>Effects of Water Damage in Berlin</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Any building that has actually suffered from water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold development. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water direct exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Permanent staining on floorings and walls is another possible impact of water damage. Walls and floor covering may require replacement or refinishing depending upon the extent of damage. Moldy odors can linger in a home where leaks or flooding have happened and this might be a sign of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>A mold examination is the first step in the process of identifying if you have a mold problem. During a mold evaluation, AdvantaClean's certified mold specialists, will check, sample and test the air around your home for mold detection. A mold specialist will utilize a range of mold detection methods to search for mold and mildew, recognize the kinds of mold present and offer suggestions for cleaning mold or getting rid of mildew. Mold examination is necessary to both the safety and health of a home and its residents. Because mold remediation can often be expensive, a mold examination performed by a mold specialist is highly suggested.</p>

<p>When standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure includes examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any changes.</p>
