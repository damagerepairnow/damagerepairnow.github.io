Always make sure you use an independent, third party testing agency, which if you use a mold remediation company, that they utilize a third party testing company themselves.

<p>You want to deal with restroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and develops a best breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the road to flooded restroom healing. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to lift and agitate the dampened mold. Move the brush in mindful strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
