Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>An insurance policy might or may not cover the expenses associated with water damage and the process of water damage restoration. While a common reason for residential water damage is typically the failure of a sump pump, numerous property owner's insurance coverage do not cover the associated costs without an addendum which contributes to the monthly premium of the policy.
