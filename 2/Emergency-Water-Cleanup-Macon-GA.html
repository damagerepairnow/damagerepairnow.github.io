<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or company is one of the most disastrous things that can take place to a family or an individual. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired instead of being fully replaced. Then the bulk of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard may need fixing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is significant then the entire floor may require replacing and often even the subfloor as well. The kind of wood floor covering you may have figures out and restricts the type of repair work that need to happen. Solid hardwood floor covering enables a larger series of choices to fix the problem. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area. This type of floor covering can also have replacements for individual slabs. The best way to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to change the affected boards and then refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
