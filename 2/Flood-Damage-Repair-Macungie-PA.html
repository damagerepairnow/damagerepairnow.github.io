<h3>Fire Damage Cleaning Services in Macungie</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold professionals typically advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold utilizing borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the option on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush till the mold disappears. There's no need to rinse it off because borax will keep the mold from coming back. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such products absorb water quickly.
