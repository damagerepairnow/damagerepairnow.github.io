<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Water damage can be the starting point for numerous serious issues that can affect a structure, damage personal property and present major health dangers to residents. To bring back property and safeguard health, an expert restoration professional should thoroughly manage the task.

Additionally, they should be able to communicate with the water damage victims and insurance provider agents with self-confidence and authority. Water damaged structures can be the perfect breeding location for mold, while poor indoor ventilation can trigger molds to thrive. Wet building products and damp indoor air are mold's best friends.</p>
