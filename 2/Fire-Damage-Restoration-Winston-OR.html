<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of property damage that a family or company can experience. When MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals instantly begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>
