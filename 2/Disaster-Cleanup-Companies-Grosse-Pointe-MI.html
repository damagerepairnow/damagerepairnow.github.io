<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall since mold and mildew can be a major health threat. However, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material must be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>To prevent mold in the basement, you need to alter the conditions that can cause it to grow.
