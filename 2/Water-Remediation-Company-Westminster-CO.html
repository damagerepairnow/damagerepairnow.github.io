Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get wet and simply starts to sag before drying, fixing it may simply need pressing it back into place, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
