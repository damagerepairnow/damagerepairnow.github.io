<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air till they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the same way, so if the location the spores land is wet and great, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water invasion that involves a considerable quantity of water absorption into low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floorings, or other complex, developed assemblies). Drying may need unique approaches, longer drying times, or considerable water vapor pressure differentials.</p>

<p>You want to address restroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and creates a best breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew.
