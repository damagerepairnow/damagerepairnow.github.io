Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
