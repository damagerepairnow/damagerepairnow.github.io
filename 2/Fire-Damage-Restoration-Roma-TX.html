<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold professionals usually recommend is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the option on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush up until the mold vanishes. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such materials take in water quickly. This might aggravate the issue since as you understand - mold loves wet environments.<p>
