<p>If you choose to work with a professional (or other expert service provider) to do the cleanup, make sure the professional has experience cleaning up mold. Inspect recommendations and ask the contractor to follow the recommendations in EPA guide Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures, the guidelines of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygenists (ACGIH), or other standards from expert or government companies.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep photos of the water damage and all documents associated with the damage and your claim in case mold grows in the future. Your insurance provider may be hesitant to concur that any possible mold is the result of previous water damage, however having records and images will serve as valuable proof of your claim. If the mold is deemed to have originated from water damage, some insurance companies may make you submit a 2nd claim of water damage rather, needing you to pay another deductible before remediation takes place.</p>
<p>Damaged locations larger than 12 square inches may require a complete replacement panel installed since big pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists. It depends on where the damage is located on the wall or ceiling and how you needed to cut it out. For example, if the space where you got rid of the damaged drywall exposes studs or joists where it will be possible to secure a spot by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you might have to change the whole drywall panel.</p>
<h3>Fire And Restoration in Dayton</h3>
<p>After removing the damaged drywall, determine the size of the hole so you can cut out a spot from a new sheet of drywall. Place 4 drywall clips around the hole. Secure every one in location with a drywall screw, making certain to countersink the screw head. Take care not to overdrive the screw. Cut out the patch and insert it, then secure it to the drywall clips (and readily available ceiling joists) using drywall screws. Beware not to over-tighten.<p>
