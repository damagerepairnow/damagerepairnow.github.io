Considering that you will be freeing soot as you clean, it is very important to lay down floor security and remove any furnishings or household things that are not damaged. You can most likely get away with simply covering furniture with plastic or sheets if the damaged location is small. But if you're cleaning a whole space, it's wise to get rid of those clean products and even seal other rooms that are undamaged. Bear in mind the shoes you're using so you do not track soot spots into other rooms.<p>
