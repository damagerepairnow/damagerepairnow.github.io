<h3>Flood  Water Cleanup Company in Hampden Maine</h2>
<p>Given that it's difficult to get rid of mold in the house entirely, it is necessary to keep your air clear by regularly changing air filters. Consider using High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, which are created to trap 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger (mold is generally 3 - 12 microns) in order to keep mold from circulating. You may also think about an air cleanser that will get rid of mold spores. If you live in an especially wet environment, find one with an antimicrobial filter to ensure that the filter itself remains free from mold.</p>

While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can trigger lasting damage and should be handled by knowledgeable specialists, heat is the most obvious, and destructive, product of this chain reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - meaning that as a fire enters into contact with extra fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
