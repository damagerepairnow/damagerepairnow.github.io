<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Estacada</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health danger and should be gotten rid of if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
