<p>Current Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot carried out in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to finish the job effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>

<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and beneficial temperatures to grow. Nutrients for mold are present in dead natural material such as wood, paper or materials; mold can likewise obtain nutrients from some artificial products such as paints and adhesives. Mold needs wetness, although some mold types can acquire that wetness from wet air when the relative humidity is above 70 per cent. Carefully pry baseboards away from walls so that you can check sheetrock at floor level. The porous product can rapidly absorb flood water, and you need to know the degree of potential damage.<p>
