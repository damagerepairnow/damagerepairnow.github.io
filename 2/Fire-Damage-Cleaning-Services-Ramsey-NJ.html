<p>Water invasion into structures can be exceptionally damaging. Jake and his guys were fantastic in helping us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to keep track of and change the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and also were very handy in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
