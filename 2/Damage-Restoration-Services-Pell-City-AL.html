<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying because the leak started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and really respectful individual.</p>
