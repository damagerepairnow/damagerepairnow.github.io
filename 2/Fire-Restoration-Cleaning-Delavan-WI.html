<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and hauled away whatever else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to get the job done appropriately.

<p>Mold needs nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperatures to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead natural material such as wood, paper or materials; mold can also derive nutrients from some synthetic items such as paints and adhesives. Mold needs wetness, although some mold types can acquire that wetness from moist air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent. Carefully pry baseboards far from walls so that you can examine sheetrock at floor level. The permeable material can rapidly soak up flood water, and you need to understand the degree of possible damage.<p>
