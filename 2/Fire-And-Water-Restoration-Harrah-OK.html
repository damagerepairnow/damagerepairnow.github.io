<p>Mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
