<p>Certain areas of your home such as crawl basements, attics and spaces are far more prone to water damage. Dark, damp crawl spaces can be a haven for mold and mildew, which is turn can then cause structural damage as they grow. The concrete structure of your home can trigger dripping in the basement if there is wetness leaking through it.

<p>Some air cleaners are designed to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing agent and a known irritant of the lungs and breathing system. Studies have revealed that ozone, even at high concentrations, is not effective at eliminating airborne mold or surface area mold contamination.

Health experts, including the Minnesota Department of Health, do not advise using ozone to resolve mold or any other indoor air issues.</p>
