<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. Now that you can determine when water damage is covered by your house owner's insurance coverage, it's essential that you to contact your insurer as soon as possible when you find water damage in your home. You must take photos of the afflicted area and everything that was damaged, along with where the water came from, such as the burst pipe or Leaky roof and home insurance.</p>
<p>Negative air devices, geared up with HEPA (high performance particle air filters") ought to be used to get rid of germs and other impurities from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage must be drawn out with self-contained vacuum equipment with correct waste holding tanks which must be dealt with effectively. Difficult surfaces that are impacted need to be cleaned up and sanitized. Soft structural materials such as carpets, rug, plaster wallboard need to be removed and correctly dealt with. Any product that soaks up considerable amounts of moisture and can not be sufficiently cleaned up must be removed. When infected materials have been removed, a 2nd application of sanitizers should be applied to all work surface areas.</p>

<p>The equipment we utilize is capable of running for days without being turned off (it will not overheat), and unless we encourage you otherwise, it is best to leave it on and performing at perpetuity until the task is completed. Our service specialist will examine the devices and job development each day, adjusting and moving equipment as needed. If you hear or smell anything which appears to not be abnormal, please disconnect the devices in concern and call us instantly at (616) 842-9800.

<p>Material Removal: Some materials will need to be removed prior to the start of the cleaning process. Typically, walls, cabinets, and ceilings near the source of the fire are beyond conserving.

<p>We will do our finest to restore your contents to a pre-loss condition. Some items, when exposed to water for an amount of time, end up being completely damaged (i.e. they will never be the same).
