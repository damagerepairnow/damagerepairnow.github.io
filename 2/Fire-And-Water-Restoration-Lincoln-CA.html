<h2>Risks When It Comes to Lincoln Water Damage in Crawlspaces</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the exact same way, so if the place the spores land is moist and good, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was simple: It was a perfect storm"-- a combination that attorneys now allege came from pressure to build faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure products, and little federal government and contractor oversight. Add to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the average yearly rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much greater.</p>
