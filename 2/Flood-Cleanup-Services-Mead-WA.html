Search for indications of wetness or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>Unfavorable air machines, geared up with HEPA (high efficiency particulate air filters") ought to be used to eliminate bacteria and other pollutants from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage should be extracted with self-contained vacuum devices with proper waste holding tanks which need to be disposed of effectively. Difficult surface areas that are impacted should be cleaned up and sterilized. Soft structural materials such as carpets, carpet pads, plaster wallboard must be removed and appropriately dealt with. Any material that takes in substantial quantities of wetness and can not be sufficiently cleaned should be eliminated. When polluted materials have been gotten rid of, a second application of sanitizers should be applied to all work surfaces.</p>
