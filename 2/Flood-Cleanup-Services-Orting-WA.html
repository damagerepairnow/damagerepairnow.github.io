<p>Corrosion is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the sluggish and gradual deterioration of materials (normally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion happens when you integrate electricity, oxygen, water and metal, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly referred to as rust). There is no trustworthy schedule for this procedure to occur; a MacBook's internal elements generally start corroding instantly after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can work usually for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of an issue. How quick the corrosion process takes depends upon a lots of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and for how long the device remained in contact with the liquid.
