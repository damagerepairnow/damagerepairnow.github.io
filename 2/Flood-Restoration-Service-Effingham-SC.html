<p>Be patient. Depending upon the level of water damage sustained, it can take weeks or months for your home's structural elements to be completely dried.

<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always convenient. Using paper tape needs some practice and little skill, however it's well worth learning. When the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the professional will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this point, the water remediation process is considered to finish.<p>
<p>A acceptable or normal  moisture content in hardwood floor covering typically varies between 6 and 12 percent, however flooded wood floor covering can frequently have up to a 40 percent moisture content, which means there is severe damage.
