<p>To get moisture out of the iPhone's interior, you need a desiccant. Many people swear by uncooked rice, encouraging owners to put their moist iPad or iPhone in a big bowl of the things (cover it totally) and leave it there for two days approximately. A: Mold is a microscopic fungus that is part of the natural surroundings and needed for our ecosystem. While it is necessary in the outside world, too much mold inside a structure can be unsanitary and unsafe. Mold produces spores as part of its lifecycle, and these spores drift through the air both inside and outside.<p>
