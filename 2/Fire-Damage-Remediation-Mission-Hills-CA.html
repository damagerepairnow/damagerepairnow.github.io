<p>Flood damage cleanup for wood floorings should be dried gradually. Abrupt drying might cause breaking or splitting. Some restoration companies can accelerate drying time by requiring air through the fluted underside of hardwood floorboards. Remove hardwood floor boards to avoid buckling. Eliminate a board every couple of feet to lower buckling caused by swelling. Clean and dry wood before trying repairs.<p>
<p>Likewise, because bleach is mainly water, on permeable surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is quickly taken in by the material. So, while you may have rubbed out or blemished the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've really supplied lots of water to grow back and potentially spread out the mold below the surface. If there is a lot of mold growth, speak with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ".  versions of these and other assistance documents are offered on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the musty material is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement may be required.<p>
