<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying devices or techniques will be the most efficient. It is imperative to determine if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based upon the outdoors temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can assist in determining what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and reasonable energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely forecasts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to numerous structure materials and how they react to each one and supply the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the quicker materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
<p>The most essential aspect of correcting drywall water damage is to avoid extra damage from mold or mildew.

Standard home fans are not efficient in moving an adequate quantity of air required to dry a space adequately.</p>
