After the issue has actually been corrected, the property then needs to be thoroughly dried, removing all traces of wetness.</p>
<p>Food sources for mold in buildings consist of cellulose-based products such as wood, cardboard and the paper facing on drywall and raw material such as soap, fabrics, and dust consisting of skin cells. If a house has mold, the moisture may originate in the basement or crawl space, a dripping roofing system or a leak in plumbing pipelines. Insufficient ventilation might accelerate wetness accumulation. Noticeable mold nests might form where ventilation is poorest and on perimeter walls (because they are nearest the dew point ).</p>
