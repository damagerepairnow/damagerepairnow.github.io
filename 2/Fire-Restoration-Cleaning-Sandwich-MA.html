<p>Water losses are one of the most common risks that our SERVPRO team deals with and can happen from dozens of different causes in Seattle houses or companies. Performance during these emergency situations helps to limit the spread and severity of these harmful conditions.

There are over 100,000 kinds of species of mold, but the most common types of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore lands on a food source that is wet and warm, it starts to sprout and colonize within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots begin to grow into the food source and mycotoxins or toxic gasses are launched as the fungi spreads. Mold in your house can be extremely dangerous and result in a variety of health problems. Making efficient mold remediation more difficult and expensive if the mold in your home is not eliminated appropriately it can continue to grow.<p>
