<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Storrs Mansfield</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health hazard and need to be gotten rid of if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
