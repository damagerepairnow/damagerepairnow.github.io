<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>To get rid of mold in the basement, scrub the walls utilizing a big brush, and remember that porous surfaces such as ceiling tiles or drywall may need to be gotten rid of and replaced. If basement carpet has actually ended up being musty, sweep it (while using a mask) to loosen the mold and let it dry in the sun if you can move it, or use high-powered fans to remove moisture if it's attached to the floor.</p>
