Using customized equipment, water mitigation contractors and their teams can draw out water from many surface areas and areas of your home. Vacuum systems can pull water up through your carpets and the cushioning that lies beneath, pump water out of your basement and drain standing puddles from around cabinets, home furnishings and components. Then, powerful fans can be brought in to dry things up as quick as possible. Time is of the essence when water is the problem.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, attempt to keep the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter and less than 60 percent the rest of the year. You can buy devices to measure relative humidity at some home supply shops. Ventilation, air blood circulation near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to decrease the production of wetness in the home are all extremely essential in managing high humidity that regularly causes mold growth in our climate.</p>

Another point is, there are various levels of contamination with water (see Categories of Water), and that will factor into the equation of what can be conserved and what must be replaced.
