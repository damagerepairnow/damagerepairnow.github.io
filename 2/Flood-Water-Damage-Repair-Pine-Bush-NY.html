The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying equipment or techniques will be the most effective. It is crucial to figure out if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system.

The greater the number, the much faster materials will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more handy if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
