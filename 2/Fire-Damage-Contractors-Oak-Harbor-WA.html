Based on research studies performed by independent labs of Chem-Dry's HCE (Hot Carbonating Extraction), P.U.R.T. (Pet Urine Removal Treatment), Granite Countertop Renewal, and Tile, Stone & Grout cleaning procedures. Irritants evaluated were canine and cat dander and dust mite irritant.

<p>Throughout a flood cleanup, the indoor air quality in your house or workplace might seem the least of your issues. However, failure to get rid of contaminated materials and to minimize moisture and humidity can present serious long-lasting health risks. Standing water and damp materials are a breeding place for microbes, such as viruses, bacteria, and mold. They can cause illness, trigger allergies, and continue to damage products long after the flood.</p>
<p>Our specialists are licensed by the Institute of Assessment, Cleaning and Restoration Accreditation (IICRC), which is the hallmark of expert understanding in the cleaning and restoration industry. You will have the ability to discriminate: Rainbow International emergency water damage crews utilize modern devices and we utilize Rapid Structural Drying techniques to dry your structure as rapidly and entirely as possible.</p>
