<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of residential or commercial property damage that a household or business can experience. Usage of Unfavorable Pressure - With the help of negative air makers geared up with HEPA filters, we can ensure dust, mold spores, and other harmful microbial product will stay within the impacted locations during the restoration process. Considering that HEPA filtering captures 99.7% of microbial matter, our machines provide an additional layer of safety to the occupants of the property as remediation happens.</p>
