Did you understand that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this implies that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve browsing a broad location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
