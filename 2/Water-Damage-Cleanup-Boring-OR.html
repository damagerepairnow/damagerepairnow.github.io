While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this implies that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve browsing a broad location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
