<h3>Fire And Smoke Damage in Benton Harbor</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health threat and should be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the suggestion of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
