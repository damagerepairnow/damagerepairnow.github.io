<p>Sadly, however, utilizing bleach is only effective if the mold is growing on non-porous materials such as tiles, bathtubs, glass and countertops.

<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for every two to three rooms, depending upon the size of the room. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it goes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which suggests that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can picture, throughout several days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
