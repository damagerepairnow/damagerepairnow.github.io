<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely destructive. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace right away. They came back every day (typically two times a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and also were really handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd advise them without doubt.</p>
