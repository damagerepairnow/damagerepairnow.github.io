<p>Any building that has actually struggled with water damage or issues with excess wetness is at risk of mold development. We know exactly what you are experiencing as we also have overcome water damage from a flooded basement in our home. Our experience has altered our lives forever. Our houses are our safe location. Home is where we raise our households, get together for vacations, and where we loosen up, unwind, and shut out the busyness of everyday life. When water intruded in our home we chose to fight back and it became our objective to assist other families through the process and after-effects of water damage. In 2014 we opened SERVPRO of West Sioux Falls to perform that mission and respond to the questions of the unknown.</p>

Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays a vital part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; indoors, mold growth need to be prevented. Mold reproduce by ways of tiny spores. The spores are like seeds, but invisible to the naked eye, that drift through the air and deposit on surface areas. When the temperature, wetness, and readily available nutrient conditions are correct, the spores can form into new mold nests where they are deposited. 1 There are many kinds of mold, but all require wetness and a food source for development.</p>
