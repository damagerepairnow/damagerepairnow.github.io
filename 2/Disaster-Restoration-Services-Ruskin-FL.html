<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove up to 18 inches of drywall due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a severe health risk. However, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be removed to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work. By decreasing the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it is essential to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and assists break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is finished.<p>
