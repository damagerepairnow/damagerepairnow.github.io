Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
