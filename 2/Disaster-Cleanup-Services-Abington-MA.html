<h3>Smoke Damage Removal in Abington</h3>
<p>It is simple for a property owner to think the damage to their home or company is restricted to the visually confirmed damage. At FP Property Restoration, we understand that this is not the case. Surrounding areas, contents, ventilation systems, and surface areas are all impacted by smoke, water from the extinguishment of the fire, and the residual smell that, if not dealt with properly, will never ever leave your residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>The most significant element that can be removed is the moisture that mold requires to cultivate. There are over 100,000 types of species of mold, however the most common types of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore lands on a food source that is warm and moist, it starts to colonize and sprout within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots start to become the food source and mycotoxins or poisonous gasses are launched as the fungis spreads. Mold in your house can be very unsafe and result in a variety of health issues. If the mold in your home is not removed correctly it can continue to grow, making efficient mold remediation more costly and difficult.<p>
