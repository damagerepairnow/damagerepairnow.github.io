<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion takes place, and it merely goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a large area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
