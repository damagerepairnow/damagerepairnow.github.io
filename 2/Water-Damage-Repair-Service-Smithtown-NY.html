<p>Water invasion into buildings can be incredibly devastating. Jake and his people were amazing in assisting us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to your house and began drying our drenched crawlspace right away. They came back every day (frequently two times a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the method and also were very practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
