<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air till they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is great and wet, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores.
