Raising the temperature level of a damp material increases the rate of evaporation, more releasing moisture from the product and changing the internal vapor pressure. The greater the difference in between ambient temperature level and humidity temperature, the higher the capacity for faster and more effective drying.</p>
<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one jet stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up. Desiccant dehumidifiers work when damp incoming air streams over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant. This process soaks up wetness without ice build-up and is not limited by low temperature levels. Desiccants can quickly operate below freezing temperatures.</p>
