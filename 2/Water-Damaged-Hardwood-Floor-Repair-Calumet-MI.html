<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold experts usually suggest is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the solution on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush up until the mold disappears. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such products absorb water quickly. This might intensify the problem because as you understand - mold enjoys wet environments.<p>
