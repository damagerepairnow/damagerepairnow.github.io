<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. During a water loss emergency, nearly every area of your Seattle home could be at risk for damage. Moving water and wetness can permeate porous surface areas and contents, which can modify their appearance and cause permanent damage within the first 48 hours of direct exposure.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have actually ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>
