<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or contaminated water. A fireplace can give your living-room a sense of heat and comfort even when there's no fire, but a weathered and split chimney can often allow rain during the colder months which can permeate through the walls. In time, moisture from the water can trigger the paint on the wall to flake, peel and bubble. Water damage can turn your cosy little living room into an unloved and exhausted  area.<p>
