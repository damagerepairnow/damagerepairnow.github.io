<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Getting it damp can turn into a major headache since the gypsum drywall is porous and soluble in water. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the event where drywall does get damp and just starts to sag before drying out, repairing it might simply need pressing it back into location, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
