<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely destructive. Jake and his guys were incredible in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying our drenched crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (often twice a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the method and also were really handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have actually ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
