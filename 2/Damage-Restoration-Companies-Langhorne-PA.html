<p>The devices we utilize is capable of running for days without being switched off (it will not overheat), and unless we recommend you otherwise, it is best to leave it on and performing at perpetuity till the task is completed. Our service technician will look at the devices and task development each day, moving and adjusting devices as needed. If you smell or hear anything which seems to not be unusual, please disconnect the equipment in concern and call us right away at (616) 842-9800.

<p>When standing water is removed, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers.

Part of our tracking process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any changes.</p>
<p>Sometimes water flows hidden down the inside of wall cavities. Other times standing water will wick up a wall.
