<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal noticeable indications of wetness, leaking water, or signs of stopping working structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels may fall apart or sag under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous gypsum product.

<p>Due to the fact that typical structure materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally related to water or wetness exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete).

Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
