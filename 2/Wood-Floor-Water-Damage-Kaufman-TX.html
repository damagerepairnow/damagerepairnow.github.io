It also makes the taping and mudding work easier to blend in with the rest of the location. For ceilings, patches that are 12 square inches or less can be kept in place with drywall clips. Anything bigger must be connected to the ceiling joists in order to securely hold the patch's weight along with any insulation above it.</p>
