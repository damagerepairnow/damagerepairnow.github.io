<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a hazardous situation for house owners, according to Plumbing 2.0's seasoned pipes experts in Mesa, Arizona It might result in a back-up of sewage in the home, contaminated drinking water and absence of sanitation till the system is repaired. When flooding or saturated soil conditions persist, a personal sewage system can not operate properly (typical plumbing issues in old houses ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater count on aerobic (with oxygen) areas to decrease the amounts of chemicals and living organisms (infections, bacteria and protozoa). When the soil is saturated or flooded, those dangerous products can enter the groundwater and your drinking supply of water.</p>
<p>Mold is a fungi that can be discovered both inside your home and outdoors. No one knows the number of species of mold exist however estimates range from 10s of thousands to maybe 3 hundred thousand or more. Mold spreads and reproduces by making spores. Spores can survive conditions that are too warm, hot, cold, wet or dry for mold to grow. When spores are launched, they can be brought by air or water to new places.</p>
