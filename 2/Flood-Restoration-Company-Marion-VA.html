<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Black mold can be dangerous to your health, mainly causing respiratory issues. But in severe cases and for individuals with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can lead to pneumonia. When you believe a mold intrusion, you may wish to invest in a mold screening kit to see what type of mold spores you're working with, and employ a professional to assist with removal. But in the short-term, here are some natural home solutions (made with things you most likely currently have on-hand) that will help eradicate mold.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surface areas starts next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are used on any difficult surface areas to eliminate the mold from the surface area. If anything can be eliminated, such as furniture, clothing, or toys, these are generally brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are eliminated, normally including deep cleaning with an antimicrobial or antifungal cleanser.</p>

Never scrape dried mold, or else the harmful spores might spread out into air and trigger unfavorable health impacts.</p>
