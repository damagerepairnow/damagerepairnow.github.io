<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your house or organisation is one of the most destructive things that can occur to a person or a family. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired rather than being totally changed. If there is minor damage then most of the floor can be conserved and a separated floorboard might require fixing.

The type of wood floor covering you might have determines and restricts the type of repair work that need to occur. Strong hardwood flooring permits a broader variety of alternatives to fix the problem. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface area.
