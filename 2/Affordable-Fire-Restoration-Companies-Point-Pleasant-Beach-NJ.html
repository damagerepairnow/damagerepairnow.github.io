<p>Keep in mind: While a lot of experts recommend a relative humidity of less than 60%, below 50% is best for controlling both mold growth and allergen.

The worst issue with mold is that it has the possible to trigger health impacts. Mold can trigger allergies and even asthma attacks, as some people dislike mold. As mold requires water to grow it is very important to prevent moisture and humidity problems in buildings, particularly ones affected by water.<p>
