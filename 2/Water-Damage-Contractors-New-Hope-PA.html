<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Water damage, water invasion, developing envelope problems, and building defects are a very major matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding locations are experiencing many concerns due to leaking windows and doors, water and wind driven rain damage.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
