Try to find visible mold growth (it might look cottony, velvety, rough, or leatherlike and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furniture or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Search for indications of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water stains, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was easy: It was a best storm"-- a mix that lawyers now allege came from pressure to develop faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building materials, and little federal government and builder oversight. Contribute to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the typical annual rains is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much higher.</p>
