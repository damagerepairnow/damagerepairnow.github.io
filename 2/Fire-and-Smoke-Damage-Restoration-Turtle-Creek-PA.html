Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
