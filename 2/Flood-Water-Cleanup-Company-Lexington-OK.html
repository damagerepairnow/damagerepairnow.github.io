Grapefruit seed extract is terrific to have on hand for different healthcare remedies and likewise cleaning potions and options. What makes it good at fighting black mold? Its primary compounds are polyphenols, called limonoids, and naringenin, which help when eliminating bacteria in laundry, cleaning carpet spills (that might cause mold development!), and for sanitizing and disinfecting spaces.

Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
