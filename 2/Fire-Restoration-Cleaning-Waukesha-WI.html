That's all part of the cleanup process, which likewise consists of vacuuming and sweeping up any dirt or small particles ignored in the remediation process. An unique HEPA vacuum makes sure that even tiny particles get collected to decrease the possibilities of the mold moving somewhere else. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold.
