<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or company is one of the most devastating things that can occur to a household or an individual. To start addressing a water damaged wall or ceiling in your home, you need to recognize the source of the water. It is possible for water to travel far from the site of the leakage and trigger damage somewhere else, in unanticipated locations. Call a certified plumbing technician to assist you out if you aren't sure where the leakage is. Without recognizing the source of the water, the issue will resurface once again later on.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we first check for any safety hazards, following OSHA and COIT guidelines for confined area entry. We then extract standing water using our truck-mounted extraction devices. If your insulation has been affected, we will eliminate the damaged insulation, bag it up, and safely get rid of it.
