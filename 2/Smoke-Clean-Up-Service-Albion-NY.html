<h3>Why You Should Hire Albion Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold specialists usually suggest is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the solution on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush up until the mold disappears. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to rinse it off. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such products take in water quickly. This might worsen the problem because as you know - mold loves wet environments.<p>
