<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying devices or methods will be the most efficient. It is crucial to figure out if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based on the outdoors temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can assist in identifying what equipment to utilize on any loss.
