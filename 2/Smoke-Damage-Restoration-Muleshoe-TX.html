It is popular for restoration contractors to collect the deductible up front when work is to begin, and we will notify your insurance provider in such circumstances. Other times, your deductible may be deducted" from the final insurance coverage check, in which case you would pay the deductible quantity at the end of the job. Another possibility is that your insurance coverage provider take the deductible amount off of the quantity they owe you for your personal contents. In all these cases, you ultimately pay your deductible, either to Flagship or in another manner.</p>
