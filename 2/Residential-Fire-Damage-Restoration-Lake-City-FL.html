<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens. An automated shut-off valve is excellent insurance coverage to have in any circumstance, especially when the hot water heater system is located inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your water heater is imminent unless repaired quickly, and the expenses go up the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The culprit might have been something as simple as a pressure relief valve requiring changing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have actually ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>
