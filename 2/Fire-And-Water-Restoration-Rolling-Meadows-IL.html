<p>When you are preparing big repairs, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By lowering the density here, it's simpler to conceal long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it's important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs.
