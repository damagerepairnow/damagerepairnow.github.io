<h2>Effects of Water Damage in Enfield</h2>

<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that due to the fact that smoke rises into the air, diffusion takes place, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this indicates that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself.
