<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens. Now that you can recognize when water damage is covered by your homeowner's insurance, it's crucial that you to contact your insurance company as quickly as possible once you discover water damage in your home. You need to take images of the affected location and everything that was damaged, in addition to where the water originated from, such as the burst pipe or Leaky roof and home insurance.</p>
<p>Since typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
