<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Torrance - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health threat and need to be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
