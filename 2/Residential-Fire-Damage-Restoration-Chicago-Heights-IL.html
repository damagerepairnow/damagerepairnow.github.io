<p>Whether it takes place in your ceiling due to the fact that of a leaking roofing system, condensation from your central air conditioning, or flooding, repairing water-damaged drywall can trigger you anxiety and stress, particularly if you've never done it in the past. If the flooding in your home includes sewage or was triggered by a sewage backup, this makes the situation more hazardous. Sewage frequently includes pollutants such as bacteria, viruses, E-Coli, and hepatitis that can have extreme health effects. Our specialists are licensed and insured to eliminate sewage water safely and restore the affected area.
