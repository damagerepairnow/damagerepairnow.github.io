The type of wood floor covering you may have limits the type and determines of repairs that need to occur. Strong hardwood floor covering permits a wider variety of choices to fix the problem. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area.
