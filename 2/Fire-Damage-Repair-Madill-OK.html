These conditions can help in determining what equipment to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, reasonable and hidden energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately predicts the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to several building materials and how they react to each one and provide the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the much faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more practical if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
