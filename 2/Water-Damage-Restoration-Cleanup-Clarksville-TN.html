<h3>Affordable Fire Restoration in Clarksville</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a permanent health threat and should be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the tip of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
