<h3>Facts About House Fire Damage You Need To Be Aware Of in Madison</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repair work. By minimizing the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is very important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the task is ended up.<p>
