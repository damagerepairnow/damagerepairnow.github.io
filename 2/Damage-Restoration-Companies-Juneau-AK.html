<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>After the water and wetness have actually been eliminated the next action to fix water damage is to clean and sanitize the impacted locations. Flood water often brings sewage and other toxins with it. These pollutants must be eliminated prior to final repairs are carried out. Commercial sanitizers and commercial cleaners will guarantee that your residential or commercial property is efficiently cleaned and treated.</p>
