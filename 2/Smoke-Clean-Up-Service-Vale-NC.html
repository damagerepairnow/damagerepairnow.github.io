If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with a really expensive paperweight if this rust procedure is not stopped.</p>
