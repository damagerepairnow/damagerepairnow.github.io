Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt how much water bill I was paying since the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & found of the leak for me and then even assisted me shut down my primary water valve.
