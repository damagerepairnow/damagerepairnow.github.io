<p>Mold in the basement can be consistent, offered the nature of basements - they tend to be a lot more damp than above-ground levels and normally have poor ventilation and little air flow, a combination that can cause mold to thrive. And of course, basements can be susceptible to flooding, due to severe weather or unnoticed leakages in the pipelines or sump pump. In addition, once mold establishes, concrete block or concrete walls can be difficult to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Once standing water is removed, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) remove the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure includes checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature level too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any changes if you have questions on this.</p>
