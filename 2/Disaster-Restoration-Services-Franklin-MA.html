<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>In a black water damage, care should be required to not interrupt the bacteria in the water and make it airborne.

<h3>Water Extraction Service in Franklin Massachusetts</h2>
<p>If you have actually simply found mold in your house or company, or experienced a water event, so you might be wondering what to do next.

<p>Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. Eliminate plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level.

This produces a chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, duct work and wiring.</p>
<p>Damaged areas bigger than 12 square inches might require a complete replacement panel installed due to the fact that large pieces of drywall require to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists. It depends upon where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you needed to cut it out.

If not, you may need to replace the whole drywall panel.</p>
