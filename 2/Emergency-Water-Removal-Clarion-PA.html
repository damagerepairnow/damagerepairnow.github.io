<p>Indoor mold development can usually be seen or smelled. Most of the times, if visible mold development exists, tasting is not needed. There are no health or exposure-based requirements that you can use to evaluate a mold sampling outcome. The Florida Department of Health does not recommend mold screening or tasting to see if you have a mold problem, or to see what kind of mold may be growing. Sampling for mold in the air can be costly and, if done, must only be done by knowledgeable experts. Examine a mold problem; don't test</p>

<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we equip the home with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for every 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the room. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it goes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which implies that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor got rid of. This procedure goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of numerous days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
