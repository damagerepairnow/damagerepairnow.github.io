<p>It's a demanding situation when water floods your floors, soaks into your walls, and damages your furnishings.

Place water-permeable packages of desiccants and damp products in airtight containers or in sealed areas, like closets. Some desiccants alter color to show they are filled, which can take days or weeks, depending on just how much moisture items contain.<p>
