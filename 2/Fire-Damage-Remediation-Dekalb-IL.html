<p>Learn how to get rid of black mold safely and efficiently. When you have water damage and aren't sure immediately from where the source of damage is coming from, burst or damaged pipes can be a major headache. Sprinkler line pipe burst frequently goes unnoticed up until the water comes hurrying through basement window wells and walls triggering considerable basement water damage. A pipe burst in the attic can lead to gallons of water drizzling down on the spaces inside your home.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
