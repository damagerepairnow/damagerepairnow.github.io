We have actually brought building and contracting experience into our franchise over the past two and a half years to better serve our communities after suffering a natural disaster.</p>
<p>Water damage emerges from broken pipes, blocked drains pipes, malfunctioning home appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The suitable treatment depends on the nature of the damage.

<p>Particular sections of your home such as crawl basements, areas and attics are far more vulnerable to water damage. Dark, moist crawl areas can be a haven for mold and mildew, which is turn can then trigger structural damage as they grow. If there is moisture dripping through it, the concrete foundation of your home can trigger dripping in the basement. Condensation in the area in between the attic and your home can cause wetness on the underside of the roofing, which can lead to mold and decaying. When inspecting your home for prospective reasons for water damage be sure to watch out for moisture in light fixtures as well as the overall condition of any obvious piping.</p>
<p>These steps should be described by an expert, certified as a mold assessor or in mold removal, and are based on the ANSI IICRC S500 Professional Standard for Water Damage and the ANSI IICRC S520 Specialist Requirement for Mold Remediation. ANSI (American National Standards Institute) recommendations are based on solid, well-documented science and represent the closest thing to a federal standard in existence.</p>
