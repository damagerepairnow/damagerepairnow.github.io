<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>In the course of a remediation, we sometimes recommend discarding certain kinds of surface areas and items. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all common products in need of disposal. That's all part of the cleanup procedure, which likewise includes vacuuming and sweeping up any dirt or minor particles overlooked in the remediation process. An unique HEPA vacuum makes sure that even tiny particles get collected to minimize the chances of the mold moving somewhere else. This help in our efforts at containment of the mold. We wish to make twice as sure that mold doesn't discover a way out of the contained work area and into a different part of the building.</p>
