<p>There are 3 basic actions to the water damage restoration process. The first step is to eliminate all of the water from the affected home. That indicates correcting any pipes problems, repairing any problems that might be causing condensation, or waiting for the floodwaters to recede, depending upon the scenarios. After the problem has actually been fixed, the home then requires to be completely dried out, getting rid of all traces of wetness.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is eliminated, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure includes examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature level as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any adjustments.</p>
