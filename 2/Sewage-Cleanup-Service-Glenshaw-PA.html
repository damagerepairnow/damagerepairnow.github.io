<p>There are three fundamental actions to the water damage restoration process. The primary step is to remove all of the water from the impacted home.

After the issue has actually been fixed, the property then needs to be completely dried, eliminating all traces of moisture.</p>
<p>Mold and mildew are kinds of fungi that rapidly reach critical mass wherever moisture is present inside your home. This can result from any variety of situations such as flooding, water build-up after a fire, a damaged pipe, or perhaps a malfunctioning HVAC system - all of which can cause trouble. Any high degree of wetness, combined with temperature level and nutrients, produces the best environment for the fungal elements of mold and mildew to thrive. It is very important to get rid of the source of the wetness to avoid the spread of mold contamination as soon as possible.</p>
