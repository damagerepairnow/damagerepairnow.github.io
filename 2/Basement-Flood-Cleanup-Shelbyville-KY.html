Water mitigation has to do with a lot more than simply drying and cleaning a residential or commercial property. There are lots of other aspects to consider, like decontamination and dealing with permeable materials (e.g. carpet or drywall) that can hold water. Germs can possibly prosper and cause future issues if left damp or neglected.<p>
