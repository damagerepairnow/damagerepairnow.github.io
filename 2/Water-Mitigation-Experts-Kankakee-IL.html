<p>Because typical structure materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or wetness exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
