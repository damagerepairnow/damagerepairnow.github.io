<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job appropriately.
