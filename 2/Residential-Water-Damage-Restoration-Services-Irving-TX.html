<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens. An automatic shut-off valve is exceptional insurance to have in any situation, especially when the hot water heater system is located inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your hot water heater looms unless repaired rapidly, and the costs increase the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The culprit may have been something as basic as a pressure relief valve needing replacing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
