<h3>Fire And Water Restoration in Jamaica Plain</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work. By minimizing the density here, it's simpler to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is necessary to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is finished, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
