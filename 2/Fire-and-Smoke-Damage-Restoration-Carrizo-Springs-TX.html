Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
