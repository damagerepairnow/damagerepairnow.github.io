Examples of Category 3 water can include, but are not limited to: sewage; toilet backflows that originate from beyond the toilet trap despite noticeable material or color; all kinds of flooding from seawater; ground surface area water and increasing water from rivers or streams; and other infected water going into or impacting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from hurricanes, tropical storms, or other weather related events. Such water sources may bring silt, organic matter, pesticides, heavy metals, managed materials, or harmful organic compounds.</p>

<p>When standing water is removed, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) remove the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any modifications.</p>
