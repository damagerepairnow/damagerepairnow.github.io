<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally harmful. When InstaScope was developed, we engaged a group of researchers at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a globally recognized specialist on the biological elements of air pollution, this group was assigned to validate and test the brand-new technology. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to produce a brand-new mold-assessment system for industrial consumers that, unlike any other approach or gadget, can provide clinically accurate, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so quickly. So when you consider all the risks of mold, InstaScope is a crucial tool to help guarantee the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
