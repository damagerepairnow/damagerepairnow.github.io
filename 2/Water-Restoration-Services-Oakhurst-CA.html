<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water intrusion that includes a significant quantity of water absorption into low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, developed assemblies). Drying might need unique techniques, longer drying times, or significant water vapor pressure differentials.</p>
