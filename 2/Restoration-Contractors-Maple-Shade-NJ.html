<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>The best remediation is done by a mold assessor who validates the presence of a mold problem requiring action and the level of damage then writes a clear scope of work including relevant standards. This file must clearly describe the steps that will be followed by the remediation contractor, for example how the afflicted area will be consisted of or what the verification requirements are. Without a clear agreement in writing the conclusions, data, measurements are left to the interpretation of each celebration.</p>
