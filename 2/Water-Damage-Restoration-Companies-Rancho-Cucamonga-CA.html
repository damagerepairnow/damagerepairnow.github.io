<p>Specific areas of your home such as crawl spaces, basements and attics are much more vulnerable to water damage. Dark, damp crawl areas can be a sanctuary for mold and mildew, which is turn can then trigger structural damage as they flourish. The concrete foundation of your home can trigger leaking in the basement if there is wetness leaking through it. Condensation in the area in between the attic and your home can trigger wetness on the underside of the roofing system, which can result in mold and decaying. When examining your home for potential causes of water damage make certain to watch out for moisture in lighting fixtures along with the general condition of any obvious piping.</p>
<p>Since mold and mildew can be a severe health risk, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate as much as 18 inches of drywall. Nevertheless, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to change the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material must be removed to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
