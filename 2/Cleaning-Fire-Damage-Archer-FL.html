<p>When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. Remove paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. It can be a permanent health risk and should be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, duct work and wiring.</p>
<p>Recent Review: A pipeline burst in my crawlspace, triggering major water build-up. Colby and Caleb got here on the scene within a couple of hours and continued to drain the area before any damage was done to my home. Colby returned the next day and installed new insulation in the area. They provided exceptional, efficient, and professional service along with being pleasant and friendly to work with. I completely recommend Affordable Restoration LLC and will call them again must the need emerge.</p>
