<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
