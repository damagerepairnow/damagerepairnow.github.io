<p>Drywall is in fact a panel of plaster (calcium sulfate dihydrate) that is sandwiched between 2 types of paper (one is a light-colored facer, the other the darker backer). It was very first appeared in the U.S. in 1916 when United States Gypsum Corporation put out a product called Sheetrock" suggested to be a non-warping, non-burning wall covering.

<h3>Smoke Damage Restoration in Cassville</h3>
<p>Prior to you clean the house, you must wear appropriate defense. Debris, soot and smoke can be hazardous to inhale, so wear a respirator if there is significant soot in the damaged location. Wear long trousers and sleeves to secure your skin. You should also wear gloves and eye security. Since you will be freeing soot as you clean, it is very important to set floor protection and remove any furniture or family things that are not damaged. You can probably get away with just covering furnishings with plastic or sheets if the damaged area is little.
