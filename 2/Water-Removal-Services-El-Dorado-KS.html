<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), likewise in some cases referred to as mildew, is a fungal development that develops on damp materials. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays a vital part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; indoors, mold development need to be avoided. Mold replicate by methods of tiny spores. The spores resemble seeds, but invisible to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surfaces. When the temperature, moisture, and readily available nutrient conditions are appropriate, the spores can form into brand-new mold nests where they are transferred. 1 There are many types of mold, however all require moisture and a food source for growth.</p>

<p>The Chem-Dry proprietary Hot Carbonating Extraction (HCE) cleaning procedure offers a much deeper, longer lasting clean for a much healthier home. Based on studies conducted by independent labs of Chem-Dry's HCE (Hot Carbonating Extraction), P.U.R.T.

We do not want spores to leave throughout the procedure and possibly get into other parts of the home or structure where they can grow once again.</p>
<p>More involved testing may involve sending out samples to a screening facility, or taking samples of the air to evaluate if there is no visible mold, however mold is suspected. Checking for mold may cost as little as $20 for a home kit or as much as $500 for professional screening. Keep in mind, though, that it is frequently unwarranted, as many remediation services will continue the same method regardless of what kind of mold is discovered in your house.</p>
