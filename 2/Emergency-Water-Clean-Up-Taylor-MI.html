These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it goes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can think of, throughout several days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
