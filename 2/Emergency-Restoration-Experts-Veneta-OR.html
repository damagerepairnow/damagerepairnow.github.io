<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job correctly.
